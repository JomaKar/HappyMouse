# HappyMouse
This is a page where you can generate unique images from your interaction throughout the mouse and the keyboard.


It works based on the mouse movement and in some keys from the keyboard.

You just have to move your mouse in the page to see what happens. By default you will be generating colored circles, if you want to change 
it for making grayscale ones you only need to press the key "A" and mantain it pressed.

For different effects keep moving the mouse while you press some of the next keys:

"a" if you want to make grayscale circles.
"<" if you want to move without generate anything (this can help if you don't wan't to make specific images and particular compositions).
"z" to make color drops.
"x" to make color drops that go to the top.
"c" if you want to make circles that will disappear after a shor time.
"s" if you want to make vertical lines that will increase their own width and also disappear.
"space bar" if you want to make circles that will increase their height and their width while loosing opacity til disappear.

Finally, if you want to erease it all, just double click.
